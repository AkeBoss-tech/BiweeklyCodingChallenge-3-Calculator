# BiweeklyCodingChallenge-3-Calculator
This is my submission for the Biweekly Coding Competition Week 3

# Features
This calculator can perform several functions. Here is a complete list of the functions it can do. 
+ '+' Addition
+ '-' Subtraction
+ / Division
+ '*' Multiplication
+ ^ Exponents
+ ! Factorial
+ | Absolute Value
+ % Modulus
+ sin
+ cos
+ tan
+ sin^-1
+ cos^-1
+ tan^-1
+ log

Along with this, the calculator has an answer storage system that can be used by typing Ans or PreAns into wherever you need to input a number.
It stores all calculations in a list that can be retrieved while using the program.
The calculator also has support for constants like e, tau, and pi.

Although it is unlike a traditional calculator, it can still perform all the functions of a calculator.
There is also a settings page in the calculator through which you can change the angle mode of the function and the amount of decimal places it rounds to.
